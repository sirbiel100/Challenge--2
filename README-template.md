# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned better what "root::" is for and also learned how to use better "::before" and "::after" css elements!


```css
root:: {}

.proud-of-this-css::after {}

.proud-of-this-css::before {}
```


### Continued development

I want to get better even more doing more challenges using HTML and CSS at first and then when i finally learn JavaScript, start to use it!


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me a lot for CSS doubts.

- [codewithsadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee/nft-preview-card-component) - He helped me a lot seeing how he made this challenge, i could get some HTML and CSS knowledge thanks to him!
